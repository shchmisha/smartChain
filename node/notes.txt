What to add:
    better way of fixing broken chains

    when sending a file, break the file up into parts each size of a 1000 bytes
    create a while loop that sends these files to the server while it has not finished sending all the bytes

Variable size data transfers

In the interpreter, turn user requests into dicts by parsing them and saving them under vars in the dicts

Create a central chain (represented by a set chain token) that is present in every node

Whenever an interaction happens, record the timestamp, request route of the interaction in the blockchain and the shared chain

Create ways to add data access tokens to the central network (add a feature to chainScript, create a token, upload this token to the central chain for that chain token, and then save that access token to the vm

Have documents be named, with a “name” key in place, in order to be able to get these documents. Also allows overriding and fetching
    can be achieved by letting data in the blockchain be parsed and then compared through the language
